Godfather ipsum dolor sit amet. I don't feel I have to wipe everybody out, Tom. Just my enemies. Don't you know that I would use all of my power to prevent something like that from happening? Mr Corleone is Johnny Fontane's godfather. Now Italians regard that as a very close, a very sacred religious relationship. I don't like violence, Tom. I'm a businessman; blood is a big expense. Sonny, please don't do anything. Please don't do anything.

Te salut, Don Corleone. We're both part of the same hypocrisy, senator, but never think it applies to my family. You talk about vengeance. Is vengeance going to bring your son back to you? Or my boy to me? In Sicily, women are more dangerous than shotguns. Fredo, you're my older brother, and I love you. But don't ever take sides with anyone against the Family again. Ever.

My father's name was Antonio Andolini... and this is for you. What's the matter with you? Is this what you've become, a Hollywood finocchio who cries like a woman? "Oh, what do I do? What do I do?" What is that nonsense? Ridiculous! Just when I thought I was out... they pull me back in. Michael, you never told me you knew Johnny Fontane! I see you took the name of the town. What was your father's name?
