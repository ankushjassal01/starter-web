Major Keys to Success

Lorem Khaled Ipsum is a major key to success. Watch your back, but more importantly when you get out the shower, dry your back, it’s a cold world out there. Don’t ever play yourself. To be successful you’ve got to work hard, to make history, simple, you’ve got to make it. The key to success is to keep your head above the water, never give up. The key to more success is to get a massage once a week, very important, major key, cloth talk. The ladies always say Khaled you smell good, I use no cologne. Cocoa butter is the key. Mogul talk. The key is to drink coconut, fresh coconut, trust me.

Let me be clear, you have to make it through the jungle to make it to paradise, that’s the key, Lion! Surround yourself with angels, positive energy, beautiful people, beautiful souls, clean heart, angel. Look at the sunset, life is amazing, life is beautiful, life is what you make it. You see that bamboo behind me though, you see that bamboo? Ain’t nothin’ like bamboo. Bless up. I’m up to something. Find peace, life is like a water fall, you’ve gotta flow.
